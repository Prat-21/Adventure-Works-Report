# Adventures Works Report Data Analysis Project
I worked as a Business Intelligence Analyst for Adventures Works(fictional), a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.
The management team needed a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and identify high-value customers.
All I was given was a folder of raw csv files which contained information about transactions, returns, products, customers and sales territories.

I used power bi desktop to-

                           1.Connect and transform the raw data.
                           2.Build a relational data model.
                           3.Create calculated columns & measures with DAX.
                           4.Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data.
