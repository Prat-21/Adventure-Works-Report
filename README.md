# Adventures Works Report Data Analysis Project
I worked as a Business Intelligence Analyst for Adventures Works(fictional), a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.
The management team needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and identify high-value customers.
