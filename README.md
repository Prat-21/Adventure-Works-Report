# Adventures Works Data Analysis
I had the opportunity to complete a project with Adventure Works Data set.
I worked as a Business Intelligence Analyst for Adventures Works, a fictitious global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.
The management team needed a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and identify high-value customers.
I analyzed their sales and returns data using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
I used power bi desktop to-

                           1.Connect and transform the raw data.
                           2.Build a relational data model.
                           3.Create calculated columns & measures with DAX.
                           4.Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data.
                          

This was an end to end project beginning with importing and data cleaning and ending with the creation of visuals and optimization of those visuals.
